I liked these sites because of the simplistic layout and colour schemes, I hate when websites have too much going on, it makes it feel too cluttered and hard to navigate. 
For my site I kept my colours and layout simple. I didn't want to overwhelm myself.   

I loved the big hero image on the baked and raised website and ended up adding a similar hero image to my site right above the nav bar.

I liked that all of the websites had hover effects over buttons, I added these to my site. 

All of the websites are responsive which shows good modern web development, they'll work on different sized screens without messing up the content. 

All of the websites had similar navigation bars, I used a similar navbar on my site, again i didn't want to overwhelm myself by creating a hamburger menu or something like that.
