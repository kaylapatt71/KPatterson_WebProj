      <p>As a family, we believe that baking
        is not just an art, but a way to bring joy and comfort to our community.
        
        Our journey started with Ann Goomes, who had a vision of creating a warm and inviting space where 
        families could come together to enjoy freshly baked goodies. Today, that vision 
        lives on as we continue to craft each confection with the same dedication and care that started it all.</p>
