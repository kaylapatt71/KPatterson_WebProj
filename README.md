**Project Description**

I used https://kit.svelte.dev/ framework to build the site. The site was built in VisualStudio Code.

This website is for a fictional bakery business. It was inspired by my late grandmother Ann who always had a passion for cooking and baking.
She had also been a massive inspiration for me and was my biggest motivation to better myself by studying. 

To save time and not get too carried away, I utilised Open.AI ChatGPT by getting it to write the content for the website.
